# Basic Quiz Maker API
This is one part of two projects. It is the API portion of a Basic Quiz Maker. More documentation may be coming after I get the second project completed. 

# Completed...
Using this tutorial/[link](https://medium.com/netscape/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-1-18691663ea96) I have setup the API for the CRUD actions.

## Notes about the tutorial
Of course I have modified the tutorial to be specific to making a quiz. I noticed some of the code used has been deprecated so I updated those parts in my code as well.

The tutorial isn't always explicit in what to do or why you are doing it. I feel I have a basic background that has allowed me to read between the lines. The Postman app they recommended to use is pretty awesome. I could have saved some time to take a closer look at some of the settings used, other wise I was able to get the API working. 

# To Do
1. Update the Schema. I need to better map my question json example to a mongo schema.
2. Create an Angular app.
