# Basic Quiz Maker
Initial setup/Under construction

# Completed so far
Using this [link](https://medium.com/netscape/mean-app-tutorial-with-angular-4-part-1-18691663ea96) I have setup the API for the CRUD actions.

# Notes about the tutorial
Of course I have modified the tutorial to be specific to making a quiz. I noticed some of the code used has been deprecated so I updated those parts.
The tutorial isn't always explicit in what to do or why you are doing it. I feel I have a basic background that has allowed me to read between the lines. The Postman app they recommended to use is pretty awesome. I could have saved some time to take a closer look at some of the settings used, other wise I was able to get the API working. 

# To Do
Obviously get the Frontend/Angular implemented. (Too much to list under this item for a readme file..)
Update the Schema. I need to better map my question json example to a mongo.
